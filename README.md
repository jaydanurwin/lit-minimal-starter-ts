# Lit Minimal Starter

This repo is a simple starter for creating a web app and/or a website with [Lit.dev](https://lit.dev)

It is designed to be as minimal as possible but still has the dependencies needed to serve and deploy successfully.

## Instructions for use:

### Install Dependencies

```
npm i
```

### Serve the project locally (for Typescript)

You'll want to run both of these commands in parallel

```
npm run build:watch
```

```
npm run dev
```

### Build static files for deployment

```
npm run build
```
